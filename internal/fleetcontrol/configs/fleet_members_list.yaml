short: List managed entities in a fleet
long: |
  List all managed entities in a specific fleet, optionally filtered by ring.

  This command retrieves all entities that are members of a fleet, showing their
  details including entity ID, name, type, scope, and metadata. You can
  optionally filter results to show only entities in a specific ring.

  By default, tags are excluded from the output to keep it concise. Use --show-tags
  to show tags for each entity.
